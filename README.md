RationMate

RationMate is a mobile and web-based platform designed to digitize and simplify the Public Distribution System (PDS). The application provides citizens with easy access to ration card details, entitlement information, complaints, and notifications about government schemes, all in one place.
It aims to make the ration distribution process more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly.

Project Overview

The traditional ration system involves manual processes, which can be time-consuming and prone to delays. RationMate modernizes this by introducing a digital platform that connects citizens, ration shops, and administrators.

Citizens can log in online and view ration card details offline.
Admins can manage shops, schemes, and complaints.
Notifications keep users updated on special schemes and stock availability.
The app supports multi-language (English & Malayalam) to ensure accessibility for all users.
